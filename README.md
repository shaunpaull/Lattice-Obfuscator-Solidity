# Lattice-Obfuscator-Solidity
Lattice Obfuscator Solidity


This code defines a Solidity contract named LatticeEncryption that allows you to create a 4D lattice, encrypt a message using the lattice symbols, and decrypt the encrypted message back to its original form. You can adjust the width, height, depth, and time parameters in the constructor to customize the dimensions of the lattice. The encryptMessage function accepts a string message and returns an array of encrypted lattice indices. The decryptMessage function takes the encrypted data and returns the decrypted message as a string.
